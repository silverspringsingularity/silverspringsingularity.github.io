<h1>THE ROBOT</h1>
<h2>OUR ROBOT</h2>
<p>Our robot at first had a box kind of look. We decided to change this look in late November because we released that the box "look" robot turned to one side is the attachment had too much weight. We decided to go with a classic base "look". This turned out much better for us, and earned us 115 points at the qualifiers. We are preparing for "States", and we would like to do more programs to run. There are some examples of what an EV3 robot looks like below.</p>
